# Steph-s-Budget-Tracker

In this assignment, I created a budget tracker that allows someone without internet to still be able to add funds and subtract funds online. Using IndexedDB to store data wehen the user is offline, it will then sync with the Mongo Database once the program is online again, saving the data to the Mono Database.
